<h1>Famous Indian Paintings
</h1>
<p>Indian art is not a physical replica of nature, but rather a spiritual imitation of nature. It is basically in terms of how it is constructed within itself and attempts to attain harmony with the geometry of existence. In India, art is when the spiritual dimension of life’s energy geometry is translated so that humans can experience it in this realm.
    Painting, like other kinds of art, may elicit emotions, provoke thought, and even inspire pride. Artists may either document history or tell a tale, or they can do both. Painting is not only an art form, but it is also one of the oldest. The painting was the finest tool for image-creation — creating pictures before the development of photography.

<h3>Bharat Mata</h3>
<img src="https://moodswag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/800px-Bharat_Mata_by_Abanindranath_Tagore-227x420.jpg">
<p>She is depicted as a four-armed goddess wearing saffron-coloured robes, holding a book, sheaves of rice, a jaap mala or beads, and a white cloth. There is a halo around her head and white lotuses blooming below her feet. She looks very calm and peaceful. Abanindranath wanted to show both strength and love, virtues of all mothers, and with the song, the novel and the recent upheavals working in his mind, he expressed his emotions in this immortal painting. </p>
<p>Abanindranath was also very inspired by the looks, calm but powerful carriage and dedication of Sister Nivedita, the British disciple of Swami Vivekananda. Though Nivedita did not know that, she was mesmerised by the Bharat Mata painting. She wrote about it in the journal Modern Review, vowing to popularise it through prints till its copies are spread all over the country. The effect of Bharat Mata on posters was so powerful that within 4 years of its creation, it was indeed a household image and an inspiration of all freedom fighters.  </p>

    <p>Nandalal Bose, the doyen of modern Indian art, was born in the Munger district of Bihar. Bose was a great admirer of Mahatma Gandhi, and produced his famous artwork Bapuji in April 1930, during the peak of the Civil Disobedience Movement. The march to the Dandi coast undertaken by Mahatma Gandhi and seventy-nine of his followers was a momentous event in the history of the Indian freedom struggle. The march was undertaken with the intent to defy the government’s salt monopoly, and thus mark the beginning of the Civil Disobedience Movement in India, with the aim of attaining Poorna Swaraj. Bose was greatly influenced by Mahatma Gandhi’s ideas and was especially moved by the photographs being published at the time, which showed Mahatma Gandhi intently marching to the Gujarat coast
Nandalal Bose was a student of Abanindranath Tagore and was well-known for his paintings in the “Indian style.” Nandalal Bose illustrated Mahatma Gandhi’s Dandi March in a painting. It was a demonstration in which Gandhi was battling the British for imposing a salt tax. Nandalal Bose made a black and white linocut print of Mahatma Gandhi walking during the protest to commemorate the date of the Dandi march and to show solidarity. It is among the most famous Indian paintings</p>

    <img src="https://moodswag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/5f06a445a7cee670bc0f1e9ead9b30d4.jpg">
    <p>The painting is of an Indian woman holding a lighted lamp in one hand, and covering the flame with another hand, illuminating her face with a gorgeous soft glow. The effect of the painting is heightened by the shadow of this woman in the back.  The woman in the painting is the third daughter of the artists, Gita Haldankar. 

        The story behind this painting is that one Diwali (festival of lights) Haldankar saw his daughter in a beautiful saree with a candle in her hand and her hands covering the flame. The rays of light radiated through the gap of her fingers and created a soft luminance on her face. This made Haldankar decide that he would paint this captivating beauty on a canvas. 
        
        The speciality of this painting is that is a watercolor painting, and thus it shows the artist’s mastery in his art. He wanted to use this medium for his painting to show the world that he has enough skills required in any artist, that he can make a painting without any single mistake. The painting has no deliberate distortions in it. </p>

<p>From the 1920s, Jamini Roy rejected the European oil medium and began to use the traditional pigments from vegetable and mineral sources. The imagery was often drawn from village life. Jamini Roy invested in portraying peasants, artisans, followers of religious cults, village women, and adivasis with immense dignity. He represented in his paintings what they held sacred with references from folk tales and narratives that permeated the rural consciousness. In this particular painting, one of his most iconic, the three women depicted as they worship, have been painted with thick, black contour lines with the application of the blue colour of the drape done flatly. The inscription mentions, signed 'Jamini Roy' in Bengali at the bottom-right corner of the painting with a brush in red colour.</p></div>
