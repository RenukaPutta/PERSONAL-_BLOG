    <p>The term "art" refers to a variety of skills, including designing, painting, performing, and calligraphy. A person may be born with a particular ability for art or can develop it willfully. It is thought to be an inherited talent, and individuals with a variety of interests have been connected to a certain state of the art since early childhood.
         And when people realise it at some point in their lives, they either pursue it as a career or, if not, do it as a way to pass the time.<br>Some people are fortunate enough to discover their inherent artistic talent at a young age, allowing them to start practising it right away.

Some art enthusiasts claim that the distinction between fine art and applied art is more about value judgements about the art than any clear definitional distinction. However, fine art frequently has aims other than pure creativity and self-expression. Works of art may be created to communicate ideas, such as in politically, religiously, or philosophically driven art, or to generate a sense of beauty.</p>
